# MapSimulator Client Parity Backlog

## Purpose

This document is the single source of truth for MapSimulator parity work against the MapleStory client.

It does three things that the old notes did not do well:

1. Separates shipped work from missing work.
2. Distinguishes broad simulator features from player/avatar parity.
3. Anchors claims to actual code seams and, where relevant, client-side reverse engineering.

## Client Function Index By Backlog Area

The list below maps each backlog area to concrete client seams confirmed in IDA.
These are the first functions to inspect before changing simulator behavior.

### 1. Mob combat and encounter parity

- `CMob::DoAttack` at `0x6504d0`
- `CMob::OnNextAttack` at `0x6528a0`
- `CMob::ProcessAttack` at `0x652950`
- `CMob::GetAttackInfo` at `0x641330`

## Current State Summary

MapSimulator is no longer "missing player simulation".
The project already has:

- A playable local character with foothold, ladder, rope, swim, fly, jump, prone, hit, death, and respawn states.
- Character WZ loading for body, head, face, hair, equipment, weapon overlays, z-map ordering, and slot-visibility conflicts.
- A working generic skill system with job skill loading, buffs, cooldowns, projectiles, hit effects, and quick-slot assignment.
- Mob and drop pools, hidden portal support, damage number rendering from WZ assets, mob HP bars, and boss HP bars.
- Several field-effect systems and special field implementations that are already present in the current simulator.

The real parity gap is no longer "does the simulator have a feature at all?".
The gap is now "how closely does the current implementation match client behavior, data selection, timing, and fallback rules?".

## Recent Progress Summary

Recent implementation progress has been folded into the backlog tables below instead of being tracked as a separate changelog.
The main baseline updates worth keeping visible are:

- Avatar parity moved out of the stub phase: action coverage, rare-action rendering, facial expression behavior, and anchor fallback rules are implemented, while mount and transform handling is partially in place.
- Skill parity is broader than the old notes implied: the simulator now loads and casts the full player skill catalog, supports runtime job swaps, shows buff and cooldown feedback, and covers more movement-family and summon behavior.
- Physics and movement now have real runtime seams for ladder lookup, float collision, movement-path snapshots, and moving-platform foothold sync.
- Combat and UI both shifted from "missing feature" to "refinement": HP indicators, damage rendering, status-bar layout, warning flashes, chat strip behavior, skill UI layout, and tooltip reuse all exist but still need client-accurate polish.
- NPC and quest interaction now have a usable simulator baseline through dialogue overlays, quest lists, and common quest-state mutations, but full scripting and inventory-backed requirements remain incomplete.

## Remaining Parity Backlog

### 1. Mob combat and encounter parity

The simulator has working mob AI and effects, but not the full client combat pipeline.

| Status | Area | Gap | Why it matters | Primary seam |
|--------|------|-----|----------------|--------------|
| Partial | Local mob combat loop | Attack patterns, cooldowns, targeting helpers, knockback, damage numbers, hit effects, and drop spawning are present, direct melee attacks now use the same delayed action scheduler as projectile and ground-warning families using WZ `attackAfter` timing instead of pure frame polling, mob skills now route their non-summon `MobSkill.img` `effect` and `mob` branches through the runtime animation layer so mob/target/screen-position skill cues no longer silently no-op, and summon skill `200` still resolves its live summon list and limit from `MobSkill.img` so temporary summons enter the field through the mob pool instead of being skipped | Good baseline, but the loop is still simplified vs client `CMob` behavior because richer non-summon skill semantics and transition rules remain missing | `MobAI.cs`, `MobPool.cs`, `MobAttackSystem.cs`, `MapSimulator.cs`, `CombatEffects.cs` |
| Implemented | HP indicators | Regular mob HP bars and boss HP bars are implemented, with combat damage text and boss HP UI integrated | Indicator baseline is present in simulator; advanced client-only indicator semantics remain a separate follow-up item | `CombatEffects.cs`, `BossHPBarUI.cs` |
| Partial | Full `CMob` action pipeline | The runtime now carries WZ `rush`, `jumpAttack`, and `tremble` attack flags through the loader and live attack entries, allows rush/jump movement during flagged attack states, recomputes direct-hit rectangles from the mob's live position when the delayed attack entry fires, triggers tremble feedback from flagged impacts, preserves puppet/summon aggro targets through AI updates, routes delayed mob hits to registered puppet targets instead of always falling back to the local player, and now preserves external mob targets through AI updates so delayed mob attacks can resolve `MobTargetType.Mob` entries against live target mob body rects and apply mob-vs-mob damage instead of silently dropping that client branch | Attack timing and branch routing are closer to the client, but `CMob::DoAttack` / `ProcessAttack` still diverge on full summon body-rect fidelity and other branch-specific side effects beyond the newly wired mob-target damage lane | `MobAI.cs`, `MobAttackSystem.cs`, `MobPool.cs`, `MapSimulator.cs` (`CMob::DoAttack`, `CMob::OnNextAttack`, `CMob::ProcessAttack`, `CMob::GetAttackInfo`) |
| Partial | Full mob stat/status parity | Mob statuses now keep concrete temporary-stat entries with expiry metadata, tick values, and reset events, poison/venom/burn deal runtime DoT damage, freeze and stun hold mobs in their incapacitated state until expiry, active temp stats now modify outgoing damage, incoming damage, and chase speed, active status flags tint affected mobs in-world for visible feedback, player skill hits now infer and apply a first client-facing slice of mob debuffs from loaded skill metadata for poison/venom, burn, freeze, stun, seal, darkness, slow, and weakness cases, and mob-vs-player hit resolution now treats `Blind` as a forced miss while `Darkness` and `ACC` adjust live hit chance so afflicted mobs can visibly whiff attacks with the simulator `MISS` feedback instead of behaving like untouched attackers | Status-heavy encounters are more legible and common debuff skills now push real mob temp stats instead of only dealing damage, but the full client temporary-stat surface still lacks WZ-exact per-skill mappings and broader special-case fidelity | `MobAI.cs`, `SkillManager.cs`, `PlayerCombat.cs`, effect loaders |
| Partial | Special mob interactions | WZ `selfDestruction` mobs now trigger reserved bomb/time-bomb actions from HP thresholds or `removeAfter` countdowns, finish through the simulator's special bomb death path, escort/friendly mobs no longer aggro the player, escort spawn points do not auto-respawn, special-death/escort kills suppress reward drops, WZ `info/damagedByMob` encounter mobs now ignore player-originated basic, skill, projectile, and summon damage so they stay on the client's mob-vs-mob damage lane, escort follow now respects live `life.info` progression by only attaching the lowest active escort index until that stage is cleared, and Wild Hunter swallow routing now holds `33101005` targets in a stunned digest state with repeated wriggle hit pulses before resolving the `33101006` follow-up buff instead of immediately killing and buffing on first contact | This covers the first client-facing slice of escort, bomb, and swallow encounters, but advanced rage/anger boss scripts are still missing | `MobItem.cs`, `MobAI.cs`, `MobPool.cs`, `MapSimulator.cs`, field systems |


## Priority Order

If the goal is visible parity first, the next work should be sequenced like this:

1. Avatar parity pass:
   Validate default asset selection, client-managed overlay/effect layers, and remaining action coverage against WZ and client behavior.
2. Skill execution pass:
   Implement queued follow-up, repeat-skill, bound-jump, rocket-booster teardown, and movement-coupled shoot families rather than extending the generic cast path indefinitely.
3. UI feedback pass:
   Add quick-slot validation, quest or balloon feedback, chat surfaces, and complete skill-window behavior.
4. Movement refinement pass:
   Remove the remaining ladder/float stubs, add passive transfer-field handoff, and tighten platform/dynamic foothold sync.
5. Interaction pass:
   Add NPC talk/quest flow, follow and direction-mode handling, and richer reactor interactions.

## Working Rule For Future Updates

Update this file directly, and always classify each item as one of:

- `Implemented`
- `Partial`
- `Missing`

That keeps the backlog honest and prevents already-shipped work from reappearing as "missing".
